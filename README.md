**Why Data?**
Because being data-informed is more powerful than just being data-driven. Numbers alone donâ€™t drive changeâ€”the stories behind them do. My mission is to uncover those stories and turn them into actionable strategies for businesses.

**What's Next?**
Iâ€™m focused on deepening my expertise in Data Science and Machine Learning, combining technical skills with business insights to create scalable impact. Iâ€™m open to collaborations, projects, and opportunities where data storytelling can shape better decisions.
